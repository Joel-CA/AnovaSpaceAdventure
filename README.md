# ANova Space Adventure
## JoyStick Serial Input Script (Arduino Script)
- Neatly packages raw sensor data into from the two potentiomitors and button that make up the arduino joystick into discrete values for forwarding to other applications
- In the case of Anova Space Adventure, this scripts **acts as the mediator between the controller and the game**

## Anova Space Adventure (Processing Application)
### Features
- Dynamic Serial port selector
  + Pop up window at application startup prompts user to select the port the Arduino is connected to from a list of all available ports
- Custom 3D models and sound effects
- Procedually infinitely looped music
  + Implemented cross-fade audio transition effect accross 3 variants of the game loop track for a unique music experience at every play run
- Music and sound effects can be toggled on/off in menu
  + Prefrences saved to disk via a .txt file so they are preserved accross application sessions
- Explosion Particle simulation animations
  + Interplolate particle colors from bright to dim accross every particle's randomly (but bounded) lifespan for smooth dissipation effect
  + Every particle moves away from their parent object (jet or asteroid) centroid in a random direction
- Arduino-controlled Jet transformations (pitch, yaw, and fire)
  + Important Context
    - The Arduino joystick outputs a raw x and y value both ranging from 0-1023 (where ~512 is the joystick at rest along that axis and 0 and 1023 represent the joystick being yoinked to either end's most extreme position)
    - Joystick also outputs "button pressed?" boolean (0 or 1)
  + The raw 0-1023 x and y values are mapped to values between -pi/4 and pi/4 to determine the pitch (y) and yaw (x) angles
  + The direct conversion to angle is passed through an easing *lerp* function for smoother rotations
  + If the button is pressed a new projectile object is instantiated with velocity vector set in the same direction as the jet forward vector (with a short cooldown to prevent spam)
    - Projectile objects despawn when outside the viewing frustum (clipped at a depth of 1000 units into the scene) for performance
- Procedually generated infinite asteroids
  + One of 5 aesteroid meshes is selected at random upon asteroid object initialization
  + Randomly spawned between 1000 and 4000 units from the player
  + Slow rotation animation and constant movement toward the player (though direction is dependent on inverted jet pitch/yaw for illusion of movement in relation to asteroids)
  + Constant number of asteroids at any given point; objects recycled when they are out of view or exploded
- Procedural star background animation
  + Similar to asteroid logic, but random positions are wider to take occupy spots in the entire viewing frustum, but excluding some of the center of the frustum as to avoid visual glitches (e.g. star flying through the jet) and for overall visual appeal
- Collisions (jet-asteroid and projectile-asteroid)
  + To keep things computationally simple, 3D geometric primitives were used as bounding volumes for collision detection
  + These bounding volume visualizations can be toggled on/off in game settings (alongside line-of-seights)
  + A sphere roughly fits asteroids
  + A height-thin and width-long rectangle roughly fits the jet
  + Hence jet-asteroid collision detection reduced to sphere-rectangle collision detection
    - Requires check for if points within the radial distance from the sphere center are bounded by all sides of box
  + And projectile-asteroid collision detection reduces to a simple distance check: is the projectile's distance from the sphere center less than the radius of the sphere? 
- (High) Score tracking
  + Bright neon text shows off high scores when newly achieved
  + Current score displayed in-game
  + This is also saved to disk alongside prefrences for high score retention across game sessions
- Dynamic in-game/gui resizing based on live window resizing
- Portably packaged into .exe (windows) for ease of sharing
  + Even comes with a custom icon for if you make a shortcut to your desktop!

## Future work:
- Progressively more difficult gameplay
  + greater number of asteroids
  + jet moves faster
- TBH the main file, anovaSpaceAdventure.pde, is a bit of a mess right now. It's a mix of gameState, object collision, GUI, sound, Serial, save data, log data, and window resizing, management. I've remedied an even more atrocious main file by making object files for all the in-game entities (i.e. Asteroid, Jet, Particles, Projectiles), but if future collaborators wish to maintain and develop Anova Space Adventure further, it would be certainly worth re-organizing the work of the main file into different Manager classes. I've even drafted an AudioManger class, but with the base game working to my liking, I won't be re-organizing further myself for now.

### üêõ Known Bugs/Limitation(s):
TL;DR: Most joystick Serial issues can be resolved by restarting the application. For your convenience, **pressing 'r' on your keyboard will restart the applicaiton automatically**.

- If you unplug your input device/Arduino while running the application, the application will not be able to re-detect serial input even after plugging your device back in. Instead, restart the application and reselect your port. Alternatively, don't unplug your controller mid-game.

- If you select the wrong port at application startup, either you will have no in-game controls, or the application will act according to random input noise, or the application will freeze up attempting to open the port. In any of these cases, simply restart the application and select the correct port.

- There are often noisy controller Serial inputs into the application when it is first loading up. There are some ignore input "warm-up" periods in place to prevent undesired selections, but if controller noise persists, then restart the application (there have been times where I had to restart the application several times before noise subsided).
